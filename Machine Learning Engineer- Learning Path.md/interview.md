Data Science with Dr. Angshu (DSDA # 1)

Today let’s discuss one of the most popular questions that is asked in any Data Science or Analytics interview. Linear Regression is one of the most popular models where the dependent variable is continuous and there are one or more independent variables.

Question. What are the assumptions of Linear Regression?

Answer. There are 10 key assumptions for Linear Regression - 5 are related to residuals (difference of actual & predicted values of dependent variable), 3 are related to independent variables and 2 are related to the model.

Residuals:
1. Residuals should be Normally distributed
2. Mean of residuals should be Zero
3. Standard deviations of the residuals should be constant (Homoscedasticity)
4. Residuals should not be correlated to each other (Autocorrelation)
5. Residuals should not be correlated to the independent variables

Independent Variables:
6. Independent variables should not be perfectly correlated to each other (Multicollinearity)
7. Independent variables should have positive variance
8. Number of observations or data rows should be more than number of independent variables

Model:
9. Regression model should be correctly specified
10. Regression model is “linear” in parameters or beta coefficients
