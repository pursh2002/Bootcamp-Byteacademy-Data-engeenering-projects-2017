*** Overfitting: Old Problem, New Solution ***
~ An overfitted model (OFM) is one that reproduces training data on which the model is built, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the training data. 
~ The model reflects the complexity of the idiosyncrasies by including extra variables, interactions, and variable constructs. It follows a characteristic of an OFM is the model has too many variables.
~ In another rendering, an OFM can be considered a too perfect picture of the predominant pattern in the data; the model memorizes the training data instead of capturing the desired pattern. Individuals of validation data are strangers who are unacquainted w/ the training data and cannot expect to fit into the modelâ€™s perfect picture of the predominant pattern. See Comment A.
~ I introduce a new solution, based on the data mining feature of the machine-learning paradigm to the old problem of overfitting, in my new book (see Comment B). The solution consists of: 
1. Identify the complexity of the idiosyncrasies, the variables, and their constructs of the idiosyncrasies. 
2. Delete the individuals that contribute to the complexity of the data.
3. A model can now be built on clean data representing the predominant pattern to yield a well-fitted model.
