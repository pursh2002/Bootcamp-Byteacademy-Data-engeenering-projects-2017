*** Bootstrapping: Basics ***
~ The idea of bootstrapping is inference about a population from sample data can be modeled by resampling the sample data, performing inference about a sample from resampled data. As the population is unknown, the true error in a sample statistic against its population value is unknown. In bootstrap-resamples, the 'population' is in fact the sample, and this is known. Hence the quality of inference of the 'true' sample from resampled data is measurable.
~ Bootstrapping is a powerful statistical technique, as it assume nothing about the distribution of the data.
~ Bootstrapping is a statistical method for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic by sampling w/ replacement from the original sample, for the purpose of deriving estimates of standard error, bias, and confidence intervals of a population parameter, e.g., the median. It is often used as an alternative to inference when parametric assumptions are in doubt. 
~ The history of bootstrapping jackknife reads like going back to the future. See Comment A. 
~ I provide many applications of the bootstrap in my new book (see Comment B).
